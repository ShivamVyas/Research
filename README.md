Test Engineering Model Prototype
Introduction
This code is a prototype designed for organizations to fine-tune their test engineering processes and needs using Python and OpenAI's GPT-4. It enables users to input test engineering queries and receive comprehensive responses, facilitating test case development and automation of repetitive testing tasks.

Features
Integration with OpenAI GPT-4: Leverages GPT-4 for processing test engineering queries.
Automated Test Case Generation: Provides code templates for efficient and accurate automated testing.
Multi-format Document Parsing: Supports PDF and DOCX files.
Custom User Interface: Interactive and user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
Installation
Python Requirements: Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Install Dependencies: A requirements.txt file is included to easily install necessary libraries. To install these libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will automatically install all required libraries such as streamlit, urllib, Pillow, docx2txt, PyPDF2, dotenv, and langchain.

Environment Variables: Set up an .env file with your OpenAI API key.

Usage
Launch Streamlit UI: Run the script to start the Streamlit interface.
API Key Configuration: Enter your OpenAI API key in the Streamlit sidebar.
Document Upload: Upload PDF or DOCX files for text extraction.
Enter Queries: Submit test engineering queries to receive responses and code templates.
How It Works
The prototype integrates various Python libraries and OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
It processes user queries related to test engineering using uploaded documents.
Generates responses and code templates tailored for test cases.
Customization
You can modify the Streamlit UI elements and styles.
Adjust GPT-4 model parameters for different response details or specificities.
Support
For any issues or queries, please contact the development team or refer to the documentation of the libraries used.
